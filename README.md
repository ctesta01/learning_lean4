# Learning Lean4

A group effort to learn `lean4` ðŸ™‚

Some things that we'd like to learn in the short-term future include: 

  - History of how the Mathlib/Probability lbrary was developed
  - How to use the Big-O and little-o notation from Analysis
  - Bayes Theorem already exists; how can we derive a posterior in Lean4?
  - Can we check the proof of the Monty Hall problem solution?
  - What would it take to extend to prove Neyman-Pearson lemma?
  - What does the proof  of there existing infinitely many primes look like?
    - Also, this could come in flavors like proof from first principles, vs. using the NumberTheory features already available.

Some of our real goals include: 

  - Calculation of influence functions
  - How to apply the calculus of Stein's Method CLTs
  - How to apply the calculus of Eigenvalues of Random Matrices

These "real goals" are motivated by the general question: If a mathematical subject has a 'calculus' to it, can we implement that 
in Lean4?  Especially, can we write methods/functions in Lean4 to apply the calculus that are formal-proof-verified.
