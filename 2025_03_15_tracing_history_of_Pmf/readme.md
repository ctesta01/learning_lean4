# History of Probability in Lean4

*Christian Testa*

What I've been reading lately: 

  * <https://leanprover-community.github.io/blog/posts/basic-probability-in-mathlib/>
  * <https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean4/title_page.html>

I also feel like this will be a really handy resource: 

  * <https://github.com/madvorak/lean4-tactics>

I want to pursue what was the the development history of probability in Lean4?  What did they start with? 

It turns out it was a lot of porting over what had been done in Lean3. 


The first commit to mathlib4/Probability was on May 9, 2023 

<https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/commit/68b21e12e6d612e77f34febea2e00a9358ce2f76>

> ! This file was ported from Lean 3 source module probability.probability_mass_function.basic
> ! leanprover-community/mathlib commit 4ac69b290818724c159de091daa3acd31da0ee6d 

Okay, so the work was older than that, but just ported over. 
We can see at the top of the file (c) 2017 

```lean
open Classical BigOperators NNReal ENNReal MeasureTheory

/-- A probability mass function, or discrete probability measures is a function `Œ± ‚Üí ‚Ñù‚â•0‚àû` such
  that the values have (infinite) sum `1`. -/
def Pmf.{u} (Œ± : Type u) : Type u :=
  { f : Œ± ‚Üí ‚Ñù‚â•0‚àû // HasSum f 1 }
#align pmf Pmf
```

So a Pmf is defined to be the following Type:

It is a function that arguments $\alpha$ of `Type u` 
which is a function that maps to real-nonnegative 
values and has sum 1 across possible inputs. 

Then there are a lot of theorems I don't understand. 

I do understand 

```lean
/-- The support of a `Pmf` is the set where it is nonzero. -/
def support (p : Pmf Œ±) : Set Œ± :=
  Function.support p
```


It looks like at this time, everything was discrete. 
There is some formalism around Carath√©odory extension
and outer measure. 

The next commit, May 10th, 2023 introduces Conditional Probability: 

<https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/commit/ab8b90a8c18c410cf369537add98df0dc8f32207> 

Again this is just work being ported from Lean3 to Lean4.

# Conditional Probability

This file defines conditional probability and includes basic results relating to it.

Given some measure `Œº` defined on a measure space on some type `Œ©` and some `s : Set Œ©`,
we define the measure of `Œº` conditioned on `s` as the restricted measure scaled by
the inverse of the measure of `s`: `cond Œº s = (Œº s)‚Åª¬π ‚Ä¢ Œº.restrict s`. The scaling
ensures that this is a probability measure (when `Œº` is a finite measure).

From this definition, we derive the "axiomatic" definition of conditional probability
based on application: for any `s t : Set Œ©`, we have `Œº[t|s] = (Œº s)‚Åª¬π * Œº (s ‚à© t)`.

## Main Statements

* `cond_cond_eq_cond_inter`: conditioning on one set and then another is equivalent
  to conditioning on their intersection.
* `cond_eq_inv_mul_cond_mul`: Bayes' Theorem, `Œº[t|s] = (Œº s)‚Åª¬π * Œº[s|t] * (Œº t)`.
```

I'm just going to focus on the parts I understand at all... 

Below it looks like they set up the notation for Œº[t|s] and 

```lean

A couple interesting examples stand out to me:

theorem cond_add_cond_compl_eq [FiniteMeasure Œº] (hms : MeasurableSet s) (hcs : Œº s ‚â† 0)

```


```lean

#align probability_theory.cond_eq_inv_mul_cond_mul ProbabilityTheory.cond_eq_inv_mul_cond_mul

end Bayes

end ProbabilityTheory
```

What stands out to me is the use of the `simp` for simplify and the `rw` tactic for rewrite.

Then we have Monad structure for Pmfs: 

<https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/commit/1a5bf78b9a1a52d104524f4483c35e94595b7916>

# Monad Operations for Probability Mass Functions

This file constructs two operations on `Pmf` that give it a monad structure.
`pure a` is the distribution where a single value `a` has probability `1`.
`bind pa pb : Pmf Œ≤` is the distribution given by sampling `a : Œ±` from `pa : Pmf Œ±`,
and then sampling from `pb a : Pmf Œ≤` to get a final result `b : Œ≤`.

`bindOnSupport` generalizes `bind` to allow binding to a partial function,
so that the second argument only needs to be defined on the support of the first argument.

-/
```

I think this is to say we use Monads to construct product measures. And I'm just guessing but I think we want 
to have this Monadic construction to be able to make category theoretic statements about 
`Pmf`. 

Another important commit was June 17 2023: feat: port Probability.Notation (#5187)

/-! # Notations for probability theory

This file defines the following notations, for functions `X,Y`, measures `P, Q` defined on a
measurable space `m0`, and another measurable space structure `m` with `hm : m ‚â§ m0`,
- `P[X] = ‚à´ a, X a ‚àÇP`
- `ùîº[X] = ‚à´ a, X a`
- `ùîº[X|m]`: conditional expectation of `X` with respect to the measure `volume` and the
  measurable space `m`. The similar `P[X|m]` for a measure `P` is defined in
  `MeasureTheory.Function.ConditionalExpectation.Basic`.
- `P‚ü¶s|m‚üß = P[s.indicator (fun œâ => (1 : ‚Ñù)) | m]`, conditional probability of a set.
- `X =‚Çê‚Çõ Y`: `X =·µê[volume] Y`
- `X ‚â§‚Çê‚Çõ Y`: `X ‚â§·µê[volume] Y`
- `‚àÇP/‚àÇQ = P.rnDeriv Q`
We note that the notation `‚àÇP/‚àÇQ` applies to three different cases, namely,
`MeasureTheory.Measure.rnDeriv`, `MeasureTheory.SignedMeasure.rnDeriv` and
`MeasureTheory.ComplexMeasure.rnDeriv`.

- `‚Ñô` is a notation for `volume` on a measured space.

Interesting... I don't know that many languages where you can define notation so 
flexibly.

Now at a more rapid pace I mention: 

  * [June 17 2023 they port over some probabilistic statements](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/d62cc4a4f2e171d3baf66a16ba8a82440312f777/Mathlib/Probability/ConditionalExpectation.lean)

# Probabilistic properties of the conditional expectation

This file contains some properties about the conditional expectation which does not belong in
the main conditional expectation file.

## Main result

* `MeasureTheory.condexp_indep_eq`: If `m‚ÇÅ, m‚ÇÇ` are independent œÉ-algebras and `f` is a
  `m‚ÇÅ`-measurable function, then `ùîº[f | m‚ÇÇ] = ùîº[f]` almost everywhere.

  * Okay, so the above mentions that there's conditional expectation details in the MeasureTheory 
  folder of Mathlib. We can find conditional expectation here: 
  <https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/master/Mathlib/MeasureTheory/Function/ConditionalExpectation/>
  * You can also find $\pi$-$\lambda$ systems here: <https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/master/Mathlib/MeasureTheory/PiSystem.lean>
  * Also, basically all of the MeasureTheory will be of interest to us:
  <https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/tree/master/Mathlib/MeasureTheory/>
